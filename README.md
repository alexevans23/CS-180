These are my data science labs from my introductory data science course. They show my progression as I learned first the basics of python libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, up to the point that the work focused more on machine learning using scikit-learn. While some code was usually included to help us download the correct dataset, most of the code is my work. I feel especially proficient in pandas and seaborn after these labs. Scikit-learn is still a little more difficult for me as machine learning was much more complex and we had little time to learn it. I am excited to continue expanding my skills in this area.
